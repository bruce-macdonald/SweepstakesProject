As a developer, I want to document (text file, comment in code, etc.) where I am using dependency injection and what benefits it adds to the structure of my application.

In the Sweepstakes/Manager project, I used dependency injection in the MarketingFirm class, to allow the firm to use either sweepstakes management style we've provided. The benefits it adds to the structure of my application are that it is OPEN to extension, closed to modification - we could add any number of different types of custom managers in the future as long as they inherit from the ISweepstakesManager interface.
